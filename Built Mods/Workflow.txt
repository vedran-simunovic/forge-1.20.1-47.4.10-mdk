Šimunović Mod - Build Workflow
==============================

This workflow explains how to build the mod using Gradle, locate the JAR file, 
and organize your release versions in the Built Mods folder.

---

Step 1: Build the Mod
--------------------
Run the Gradle build command from your project root:

    ./gradlew build

This will compile the mod and generate a JAR file.

---

Step 2: Locate the Built JAR
----------------------------
After the build completes, find the JAR in:

    simunovic-mod\build\libs

It will have a name like:

    simunovicmod-1.0-1.20.1.jar

---

Step 3: Test the Mod Locally
----------------------------
Copy the JAR file to your Minecraft mods folder to test:

    \Desktop\Minecraft 1.20.1\mods\

Launch Minecraft to make sure everything works as expected.

---

Step 4: Organize the Built Mods
-------------------------------
1. Copy the JAR file into the versioned folder in your repo:

       Built Mods\ŠimunovićMod Versions\<New Name>

   Replace `<New Name>` with a descriptive name for this build (e.g., Add Galaxy Armor).

2. Update the latest version:

       Built Mods\ŠimunovićMod Versions\latest

   Copy the same JAR here so users always have access to the most recent stable build.

---

Step 5: Commit Changes
----------------------
Once the new JAR is in place, commit the changes to Git:

    git add Built Mods/ŠimunovićMod Versions/<New Name>
    git add Built Mods/ŠimunovićMod Versions/latest
    git commit -m "Add new mod build: <New Name>"
    git push

---

Tips & Best Practices
--------------------
- Use clear, descriptive names for versioned builds.
- Keep the `latest` folder up to date for easy access.
- Avoid committing temporary or local Gradle files (like `run-data/` or `build/`).
